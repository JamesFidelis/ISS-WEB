        <p align="center">To create a school community
            where children participate, excel and are
            proud of their achievement to become competitive
            yet compassionate individual equipped with skills
            and competencies of 21st century.We believe that a happy child
            is a successful one. We are committed to providing a positive,
            safe and stimulating environment for children to learn, where all
            are valued. We intend that all children should enjoy their learning,
            achieve their potential and become independent life-long learners.
            Our goal is to support and nurture the childrenâ€™s and our own natural
            desire to be life-long learners. We are committed to the families we
            serve, providing support and encouragement.We aim to provide a safe
            learning environment with a welcoming atmosphere which creates a sense
            of belonging amongst the families. We maintain an inclusive environment
            which acknowledges and respects children from diverse family and cultural backgrounds.
            Our vision is for each child to develop a curiosity of learning, discover their interests
            and grow in their love of learning. We also desire to have strong families through parent
            support/fellowship and skills training.</p>
